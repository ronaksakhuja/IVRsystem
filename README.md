# IVRsystem

Instructions to install: Install the apk file in the root directory in your android phones.
How to use : 
1) Dial 121 in our dialer and press call.
2) click on the screen to activate voice recognition. We had a challenge. We did not have IVR system available so we implemented the technology on android but it can be easily replicated on IVR.
3) Make commands like :
      *What is my Balance?
      *I want a broadband connection.
      *I want to know about best offers
      *I want to know about payment banks
      *I want to a internet recharge.
